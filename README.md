Hello Visitors,

# Welcome to Alloc8Me

I'm **Chethan Patel**, a Data Scientist, and I graduated from BMSIT in 2023. I created Alloc8Me because I noticed something important: students often mix up college names like RVCE and RVIT, PESU and PESCE, BMSCE and BMSIT. This mix-up can lead to students missing out on top colleges, like RVCE.

Let me explain why this matters: RVCE is one of the top three colleges, known for its excellent education and opportunities. On the other hand, RVIT, while a good college, is not the same. Sometimes, students accidentally choose RVIT instead of RVCE. This mistake means they might miss the chance to get into the best college they deserve.

For instance, imagine a student with a good rank choosing RVIT as the first choice while doing option-entry thinking it as RVCE. They might miss the chance to study at RVCE, which could impact their future opportunities.

I created Alloc8Me to provide a clear overview of college names, available branches, locations, and cities. Students can interactively use the dashboard by inputting their rank, category, preferred branches, and city.
